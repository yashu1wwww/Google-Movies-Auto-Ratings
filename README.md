# Google-Movies-Auto-Ratings

#Watch up to 3 minutes and 46 seconds, and then remain in the remaining part copying the part of the script and save it as l.py. The script is used to automatically like a particular YouTube video with multiple accounts

## replace 24th & 33 line with movie google ratings(replace movie with your needed movie in 24th line) & review comment in 33th line in ratings.py file..

First, open Chrome file location and bypass the location restriction using an extension such as Touch VPN. In my case, the Chrome location(use start in: path) is

C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

Next, in the command prompt, navigate to the Chrome directory using the command cd C:\Users\Hp\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application

Then,

use the command

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="enter your localhost path here"

to open Chrome with remote debugging enabled. In my case, the command was

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\Bots\Chromedriver\Localhost"

## then new terminal in that folder and enter ratings.py

After opening Chrome, paste the following two lines of code from the script into the command prompt and hit enter. This will open The movie name in google and open movies ratings and automatically rate,comment & submit.

Finally, in the command prompt, enter "pip install Random" and hit enter to install the necessary library.

👉Note:-

👉If you have the latest version of Selenium, the code may not run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
